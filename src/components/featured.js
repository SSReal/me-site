                Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be very rich?
                Cuz I have, and I want to be very rich.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where there's will, there's way. That's how the saying goes,
                so keep striving for things you love and do the things you love to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will try to put up different posts on this featured tab every now and then,
                till then, enjoy!
            </p>
        </div>
