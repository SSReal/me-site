# Me-Site
Me-Site is a microblogging website, where users can share things they love and care about.

Users can vibe over shared interests, put educational posts up, or just have a normal conversation with people.

This site will feature log in using Google and email, following and follower system, posting, commenting on posts, and featured tabs.
